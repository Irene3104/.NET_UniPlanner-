3. TASK/ASSIGNMENT TRACKING
   - Manage assignments with due dates and priorities
   - Link tasks to subjects for better organization
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
   - View overdue and upcoming tasks

4. TODO LIST
   - Personal task management separate from academic tasks
   - Categorize todos (Personal, Work, Shopping, etc.)
